# PTC0402K
A fully isolated (channel to channel and channel to input) four channel, two output programmable temperature controller and logger.

This project was built with a few target features in mind:
- Four input channels with at least 0.5C accuracy.
- SCPI interface to interface cleanly with the rest of my lab setup.
- Complete isolation of each channel (at least 230VAC) both between channels and between mains. This allows you to put a thermocouple directly on a live heatsink without risk of damaging the device or anything attached to the other thermocouples.
- A couple of relay outputs for potentially controlling heaters or coolers to allow temperature control.
- USB Type-C for both power and communications for simple setup.

## Status
The first boards have been ordered and are currently being manufactured. Once they arrive it will be a job of software integration and performance verification. In particular I have concerns about the switching noise generated by the DC-DC isolators and the effect they might have on the achievable accuracy.
